# Chabod_x - still in progress

Chabod_x is a fullstack blog-folio web-app.

I am building it as a brand new blog-folio (portfolio web-app + custom blog + more) project for every interested person - beginning with myself.

The project back-end is built with NodeJs using ExpressJs. Database is MongoDB, and ODM is Mongoose.

> ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ Best news is that - **It's FREE FOR USE BY ANYONE, AND ITS OPENSOURCE TOO**.

This project will help you own a portfolio website which also contains a super-amazing custom blog - **"FOR FREEEEEE!!!"**

> Please note however, that you'll need to add this simple attribution to the base/footer of your own clone.
> "Thanks to chabod-x(link back to the chabod-x repo), and ajokpainmo(link to my website - https://ajokpainmo.com)"

## Features

1. > A complete front-end.
2. > powerful back-end functionalities:
   >
   > - a blog.
   > - a newsletter + mailist.
   > - an admin section for managing the blog, interacting with visitor messages, and for other tasks like sending newsletters/emails.

## Available routes.

> The project is still much in progress. so navigating routes might not be possible. You can try out manual navigation by manually changing the URL in the browser's address bar. Below are the three main available routes.

1. The home(portfolio website) route - https://chabod-x.vercel.app.
