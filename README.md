# Chabod_x - still in progress

Chabod_x is a fullstack blog-folio web-app. It is a new and more powerful/advanced version of the [Chabod project](https://github.com/Okpainmo/get_chabod). It's a sleeker and super amazing NextJs/ReactJs + NodeJs Version.

I am building it as a brand new blog-folio (portfolio web-app + custom blog + more) project for every interested person - beginning with myself.

The project back-end is built with NodeJs using ExpressJs. Database is MongoDB, and ODM is Mongoose.

> 📢📢📢 Best news is that - **It's FREE FOR USE BY ANYONE, AND ITS OPENSOURCE TOO**.

This project will help you own a portfolio website which also contains a super-amazing custom blog - **"FOR FREEEEEE!!!"**

> Please note however, that you'll need to add this simple attribution to the base/footer of your own clone.
> "Thanks to chabod-x(link back to the chabod-x repo), and ajokpainmo(link to my website - https://ajokpainmo.com)"

## Features

1. > A complete front-end.
2. > powerful back-end functionalities:
